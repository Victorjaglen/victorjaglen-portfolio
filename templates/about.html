          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Software Development Engineer with 1 year of professional experience at Enpass Technologies,
            building and maintaining backend systems using Python and Django. My work focuses on designing
            RESTful APIs, implementing complex business logic, managing subscription and licensing workflows,
            and optimizing PostgreSQL databases for performance and scalability.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work extensively with Django REST Framework, background task processing using Celery, and
            production debugging to ensure reliability and data consistency across web, desktop, and mobile clients.
            My experience includes schema design, ORM optimization, transaction handling, and analytics-driven insights
            using SQL and monitoring dashboards.
          </p>
            <p>
            Currently, I am expanding my skill set by exploring Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using Python,
            I am passionate about building scalable systems, writing clean
            maintainable code, and continuously improving as a backend engineer.
